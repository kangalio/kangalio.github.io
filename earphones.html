Hi, I recently spent a couple hours scouring wired earphone <50€ reviews in the internet and bought and tested the five models that came up the most:

- Panasonic RP-HJE125E-K (7.99€)
- JBL Tune 110 (9.99€)
- Moondrop Quarks (14.99€)
- Moondrop CHU II (18.99€)
- SoundMAGIC E11C (43.99€)

Here's my opinion/judgment:

Panasonic:
+ easily and snugly slots into ear canal
+ powerful bass
- no mic
- no volume/playback control buttons

JBL Tune 110:
+ quite powerful bass
+ has a good sounding mic
+ has volume/playback control buttons
- playback audio slightly bleeds into recorded audio

Moondrop Quarks:
+ has volume/playback control buttons
+ has a mic (didnt test it tho)
- silicone caps very frustrating to put on
- weak bass

Moondrop CHU II:
+ incredibly fancy and professional packaging / look and feel / accessories
- silicone caps very frustrating to put on
- weak bass
- no mic
- no volume/playback control buttons

SoundMAGIC E11C:
+ powerful bass
+ has volume/playback control buttons
+ has a good sounding mic (slightly more muffled than JBL Tune 110 according to friend)
+ playback audio doesnt bleed into mic audio at all

In the end, I went with the JBL Tunes 110 because they have damn satisfying bass, and the mic and buttons are convenient, and they're just 10€
